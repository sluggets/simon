Pay some mind to colors, design sense

GAME-ON-BUTTON
  Set up handler for the "master switch" of sorts, the on/off button. This is going to:
    1) Illuminate the score-count display and ensure it is set to "00".
    2) Toggle on-flag to "true". Other buttons will check this value to decide whether to actually perform any functions/set globals or simply do nothing.
    3) Graphically indicate that "game-on-button" is selected and "game-off-button" is de-selected.

GAME-OFF-BUTTON
  Use "master switch" handler.
    1) Darken score-count display, set to "00".
    2) Toggle on-flag to "false". 
    3) Reset/Erase ALL globals!  
    4) Set all conditions to initial state.
